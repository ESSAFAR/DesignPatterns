- We want to represent a hierarchy of objects

- For example, we have multiple shapes, and we want to group them inside one group

- A priori, We can declare two classes : Shape and Group, group has a list of objects (can be shape or other groups)

- The first problem we encounter is that we want to treat objects like we do with groups : we want to gather multiple
groups in a group, if we used Object class, we have to use if else for each method


We basically want to create a common treatment for different objects => POLYMORPHISM

- The common behavior (In our case is the method render()) will be stored in an interface called Component
